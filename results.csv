I used to think Alien Gear holsters were the best, until I tried Black Arch.Now for the Glock.  I bought it off an older individual in 2010 who bought it new in the early 90s.  He NEVER fired it, but unfortunately, he did throw the box out. I sent it to Glock for them to replace all internals, and mill the slide for the new 15 degree extractor.  Gen 2 Glocks have 90 degreemags extractors, which did cause extraction problems in a lot of Glock 21s.  No other gen 2 models were problematic with the 90 degree extractor.  All gen 3, 4, and 5 Glocks have 15 degree extractors.  After, I got it back, I had front cocking serrations added to slide and I had the top of the slide dished out.  Afterwards, the slide, barrel, and extractor were refinished in black cerakote and Glock night sights added.I have many more pics...my cell is 940-923-4385...I am in Tontitown.  We both know a used Glock is not worth $600, but don't forget the 12 like new hi cap mags and quality NEW holster.  Gen 2 Glocks are getting harder to come by, especially in like new condition."

The overall condition of this rifle is very good/excellent . With the exception of the safety lever, all serial numbers match. The condition of the bore is excellent, essentially perfect to my eyes. The previous owner of this rifle skillfully repaired a cracked wrist as well as reblued the firearm, and frankly his work was outstanding. All and all, this is both a cosmetically beautiful and functionally perfect firearm. I got this rifle lumped into a larger trade, and I already have a couple M1916s, so I am selling this one. There is nothing wrong with the gun.A word about Spanish M1916 Mausers:If you are knowledgable about 1916 Mauser's, you will be pleased to learn that this particular rifle was originally purchased from SAMCO in the 1990's. This rifle is NOT one of the bottom of the barrel rejects which recently flooded the market after SAMCO's liquidation sale. Additionally, the previous owner was a knowledgable man and fired low pressure handloads through this rifle, so it was not abused by full power .308 in the way that others like it have been.If you are not familiar with the M1916 rifle, you should be aware that there is great debate on the history and proper chambering of these rifles. I won't turn this classified ad into a history lesson, but here is the main takeaway: This is a military rifle chambered in a military cartridge (7.62 NATO). This rifle is NOT chambered for the American hunting cartridge .308 Winchester, and although many claim to fire large amounts of such rounds without incident, it is generally regarded as potentially unsafe. I say it is not worth taking the risk. Additionally, this rifle is not chambered for 7.62 CETME, as some others claim.The bottom line is that this is a historic military firearm. Unlike a modern commerical hunting rifle, it wasn't designed to be idiot proof. Unlike its descendant the Mauser 98, it wasn't built like a tank. For someone who understands the capabilities and limitations of a small ring Mauser however, its a highly capable and versatile tool.  Whether as a deer rifle, a truck gun, a target rifle, or all of the above, this lightweight short rifle can be loaded to safely and reliable perform in many roles. Definitely an interesting collectable as well.Leather sling is included. Better pictures available on request, don't hestitate to ask questions."

This pistol is from my Personal Collection. I acquired it several years before I became a dealer. I doubt that it was ever shot prior to my acquiring it. Since I've owned it probably put a hundred rounds through. It always works. No matter what ammo I use, it never has a misfeed. Like all Ravens, this is strictly for up-close-and-personal work. No 3-inch groupings with this model firearm. That's just the nature of the beast. For years I've used it for shirt pocket carry. Just took a pristine Guardian 32 ACP pistol in trade that is going to be assuming that role. Now, if you have about $450, you too probably should opt for a guardian, but if you don't have that much cash to spend for an occasional carry pistol, then this raven would be a great option. I know I have the original box and possibly some paperwork to go along with the gun. I think the box is a little crushed, but still decent shape."

This 25 year old revolver is from the days when Smith and Wesson made handcrafted firearms, before the use of MIM parts, and long before the days of the ridiculous internal safety lock of current models.This excellent revolver belongs to my best friend who has owned it since he bought it new in 1992. He doesn't really want to part with it, but some vehicle repair expenses make it necessary. The revolver comes with Hogue rubber grips, a pair of custom wood grips, and a nice leather belt holster. This model in this barrel length is very hard to find these days, and would be equally at home on the firing range or as part of a collection. I owned this revolver briefly in 2014, and sent it back to the factory for a thorough cleaning and adjustment, so it is in excellent condition. I'm handling the sale for my friend because his work schedule makes it difficult for him to show the pistol.The revolver can be seen by appointment only at my office just outside of Homestead. Please be aware that since I am listing this for my friend and do not own it, I have limited flexibility on price, and am unable to consider any trades on this firearm. Sorry about that. Face to face transactions only, no shipping. All laws complied with in this sale. Thank you for looking at this listing."

I used the 405s to drop two wild bulls with one shot each, bang flops, fastest drops ive seen on this critters besides one i hit with a 175grn from my 7mm STW.The 6.5 Is point and click death on smaller game out to 300yds or so, and longer hits are possible but i havent done anything besides shoot rocks father out.The loads i use are 123Amax/SST at 2500fps, and 100gr Balistic tips at 2770. Recoil on this round is also low, and with the muzzle break attatched the same as a hot loaded 5.56specs on the gunAnderson Multi LowerJP reduced power spring kit (totaly reliable)Polished Mil-spec trigger, hammer and disconectorTrigger engagment adjustable Grip screwI cant rember who made the grip thats on it, but it fits well and is comfortable. Also included is the original ATI scorpion i had on the gun, that grip is VERY comfortable if you have large hand, but was hard for folks with smaller hands to use.The stock, is an ATI ultralite, with the cheek riser. The riser gets in the way of the operating handle unless the stock is fully extended, but i prefer the looks of the gun with it on so ive lived with having to open the stock to charge the rifle. If you want to remove it its only a couple screws on each side. Not pictured but included is the larger heavier recoil pad that does a wonderful job soaking up the hit from the .458, tho even with just the padding i put on the back of the regular ati stock its pretty mild.I also have an extra power buffer spring, and extra heavy buffer which is nice with the .458 but not necessary. The grendThe .458 upper is from Radical, and features their upgraded 15"" freefloat tube, as well as the Panzer brake. Ive recently gone to a Hogue non over molde 13"" tube handguard as the pic rails were hanging up on brush. I still have the longer Hybrid rail which can be purchased for $60Bolt is matched to the barrel and is MPI/HPT tested.Ive got probably 300rounds on this upper, and its functioned flawlessly.The scope is a Bushnell Legend Ultra HD 1.75-6x32 with a shotgun doa reticle. The reticle tracks pretty closely to the loads im running in the gun.6.5 Grendel upper is one i put together myself.The reciever is an ultralite smoothside, Spartan from Joebobs. Tbarrel and bolt are from Radical and matched, 20"" 1-8 twist so if your inclined you COULD shoot the heaviest bullets available, but ive stuck with 100-123s. The barrel was turned down to an ultralite profile by Ar15barrels.13"" Slim profile Matrixarms keylock handguard. I also changed this to 15"" Matrix HandguardThe upper comes with a break that works really well, but is quite load, and an aluminum barrel shroud for use when hunting (or to keep from annoying fellow shooters with the muzzle blast). I also have a thread protector should you want to run without either.Topped with a 1.5-5x20 Brunton Eterna, this scope is lite and offers plenty of magnification for shots out to the edge of what i would consider ethical range for the 6.5 cartridge. Glass on this scope is excellent and the finger adjustable turrets, actually make dailing shots in at range surprisingly easy.I have 4 or 5 mags for the .458, it uses standard 5.56mags. Some of them have modified followers which allows a full 5 rounds in a 10rnd magazine, these will NOT work as 5.56s mags unless the followers are replaced.I only have 1 mag for the Grendel. The front its notched to allow bullets to be seated out to 2.34"" which actually makes a difference in this small case. If you use the longer OAL than it only holds 5-7 rounds, cant remeber off hand. If you use shorter oals or factory bullets, you can fit a full 10.The gun comes with Dies for both calibers. I am keeping the components for the .458, but ill give the buyer what ever 6.5 stuff i have left.Both guns pictures will be changed when i get a chance to take new ones.questions etc drop me a line8083152000Keao"

This break looks cleaner on the pistol than the LW brake does, but dosent do as good a job at attenuating the recoil generated by top end .45Super loads.Ok so a little history on the pistol, and the reason for the parts etc.Ive owned the gun for a while, and have spent quite a bit of time and energy on it. The pistols fun, accurate, and with the correct loading VERY powerful.The parts ive added are all basicly to duplicate the .460 Rowland, but with a standard .45 ACP chamber, which allows the use of regular ACP rounds without swaping barrels (cause taking off the muzzle breaks is annoying). With the different guids, and springs, the gun can be tailored to run reliably with anything from regular 230 ball rounds at 850 upto (and exceeding, tho i never felt the need), 230s loaded to 1250FPS in the correct .45 super brass.Right now the gun is set up with the LW break and 24# spring, which allows it to comfortably handle all but the weakest .45ACP ammo, as well as what became my standard loadings of 200grn XTPs at 1250 (the 230s didnt seem to work any better and recoiled quite a bit more).I will include my load data, reloading dies, and what components i have left.thanksKeao8083152000"

I doubt you'll have any issues with anything else. It's quite accurate for a pistol as well. I've been able to consistently hit an 10"" gong at 200 yards with it.All this being said, this is a pistol and is registered as such. So a CPL+RI-010 or purchase permit is required to purchase/trade.

Holds 7 rounds in the cylinder and if you didn't already know this is one of the few revolvers out there that can actually be suppressed, so it's a pretty interesting design. Pistol works great and still has a good clean bore and overall finish is very nice. Seems to have been rearsenaled at some point in its life likely sometime around WWII so it's still just about perfect.For whatever reason this example is missing the double action fly and spring, both of which are available cheaply ($13 for the fly for example) from buymilsurp(dot)com. Without those two small parts the pistol still works fine but is simply restricted to single action only, which some of these were naturally manufactured as such anyways.Included are the original holster, lanyard, and cleaning tools.Asking $275 for the package deal. No shipping. Lowered the price a little as I figure if you elect to buy the two small missing parts to restore DA function it'll probably run you about $25 from the aforementioned supplier.Contact me via text at: 231-690-067fiveThanks"

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges .45 ACP. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16” barrel is threaded 1/2”-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7” with the stock collapsed, and 30.6” when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides. The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum.

R. Sales Co., National Ordnance, Inc. and Federal Ordnance, Inc.A. R. Sales Co. was established in 1968 and owned by Ilia I. Karnes. Jack Karnes, his wife Ilia, and their two children ran the company. Mr. Karnes was a tool and die maker by trade. When the family business started, its first large contract was to make M16 scope mounts. The two letters, A.R., were taken from the first two alphanumeric characters of the commercial name for the M16 rifle. Next, A. R. Sales produced high-end lightweight alloy M1911 style pistol frames and accessories.It appears that A. R. Sales started on the semi-automatic M14 type rifle project by October 1971. An advertisement for its Mark IV rifle appeared in the October 15, 1971, issue of Shotgun News. The response from the civilian market was overwhelming. This included 2000 or more mail-in orders with the $15.00 deposit for a stripped Mark IV receiver.A. R. Sales received its initial batch of Mark IV receiver castings by no later than March 07, 1972. This first set of receivers were used by Jack Karnes to set up fixtures and tooling for the machine tools. There were two Mark IV receiver production lots for the company. The first occurred in the winter of 1973. The first Mark IV rifles and stripped receivers were delivered to customers in January 1973. Mark IV serial number 0143 had been delivered to the buyer on March 02, 1973. The first production lot of Mark IV receivers was cast at Rimer Casting Company (Waterville, OH) using Karl Maunz’s receiver master die according to two sources and Prico (Los Angeles, CA) according to a third source, all highly reputable. The first production lot of Mark IV receivers was machined by A. R. Sales. The first lot of receiver serial numbers ended somewhere between 0001 and 0225 with 200 receivers produced.The second receiver production lot was made in 1976. The receiver serial numbers for the second lot were started at a number below 0226 and ended at number 0250. The second production batch of Mark IV receivers was cast at Gray-Syracuse, Inc. and machined by Valley Ordnance Co. About twenty-five receivers were produced in the second batch.Twenty-five serial numbers were skipped between the first lot and the second lot. The missing serial numbers were allotted for tool room samples and for intended-but-never-realized forged receivers. Both production lots of Mark IV receivers were heat treated by a local company in southern California.A. R. Sales Co. at first bought M14 parts brand new directly from USGI contractors. Mark IV rifles were assembled with new and used USGI M14 parts and USGI M14 wood stocks. Any used M14 parts that were broken or worn were compared to the USGI drawings and rejected in the build procedure. The stock selector cutout was filled in for each assembled Mark IV rifle. According to the October 1971 A. R. Sales Co. specification sheet for the Mark IV rifle, “While most of our rifles will be built with N.M. barrels, we do not glass bed the actions, nor do we produce match grade weapons. We feel that this is best left to those who specialize in accurizing and building match grade weapons, and we do not wish to infringe in their domain.”"

Comes with soft case, two mags, two sets of grips with one being rubberized gold pony stamped target grips. Every gun collector should have at least one Custom Gun in their stable of guns. Les Baer's Premier II© has become the industry standard to which all other factory or custom built 1911s are compared. The 5"" long Government Model (pictured ) is the best single stack duty, defense or competition pistol you'll find in America …. the best quality, the best value and the best performance. No wonder so many of them show up at IPSC Limited Class matches. The Premier II© is even guaranteed to shoot 3"" groups at 50 yards! That means that 99% of them will be closer to 1.5” groups at 50 yards in a ransom rest. The Premier II© has become the flagship of Les Baer's 1911 line of pistols. It performs like a million bucks, but it costs a whole lot less than Wilson Combat, Nighthawk, Ed Brown etc. I can say that unequivocally, because I have owned all 1911's just mentioned. This Premier II will out shoot all of them. Features include: Baer NM steel frame, NM slide and NM barrel with stainless bushing • Slide fitted to frame • Double serrated slide • Low mount LCB adjustable sight with hidden rear leaf • Baer dovetail front sight • Lowered and flared ejection port • Tuned and polished extractor • Baer extended ejector • Baer checkered slide stop• Baer speed trigger with crisp 4 lb pull • Baer deluxe Commander hammer and sear • Baer beavertail grip safety with pad • Flat serrated mainspring housing • Beveled mag well • Polished feed ramp and throated barrel • Baer extended ambidextrous safety • High checkered front strap @ 30 lpi • Pistol tuned for total reliability • Baer Premium Checkered grips • Blued finish • (2) 8-round premium magazines.
